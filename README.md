## About

I design and build systems from scratch — with a focus on performance, correctness, and scalability.

My work spans distributed backend systems, secure key architectures, real-time infrastructure, and product engineering across web and mobile.

Comfortable owning architecture end-to-end: system design → implementation → deployment.
